- 👋 Hi, I’m Kristel.
- 👀 I’m interested in part-time software testing jobs or projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software testing. I have completed a 122 hour course at the Software Development Academy and am eager to improve my skills on planning and conducting software testing. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on static testing but would like to conduct dynamic testing as part of a group to learn from each other.
- 📫 You can reach me via personal messages.
